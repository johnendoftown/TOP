    <h1>Knowledge Check: Commit Messages</h1>
    <h2>What are two benefits of having well-written commit messages and a good commit history?</h2>
    <p>To be able to clearly collaborate with others and refer to your history of changes</p>
    <h2>How many characters should the subject line of your commit message be?</h2>
    <p>50, with a maximum of 72</p>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>Using the command line to write Git commits is preferable</p>
    <p>Commits use the imperative mood, which is spoken as if given a command or instruction. To do this clearly, use the phrase "If applied, this commit will...". For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Update getting started documentation</li>
        <li>Release veriosn 1.0</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The title should be capitalized and no more than 50 characters, more will be cut off by github</p>
